This is a Dynamic Tree(aka AABB Tree) native extension for [Defold Engine](https://www.defold.com/).    
DAABBCC3D build by using Box2Dâ€™s [Dynamic Tree](https://box2d.org/documentation/md_collision.html#autotoc_md46).  

This is the 3D version.

**What is DAABBCC?**

A Dynamic AABB Tree is a binary search algorithm for fast overlap testing. Dynamic AABB trees are well-suited for general-purpose use and can handle moving objects efficiently. This data structure provides an effective method for detecting potential overlap between objects.  

DAABBCC is not a physics engine. It does not include narrow-phase collision detection or manifold generation.  

It is particularly well-suited for casual games, platformers, bullet-hell, top-down games, server-side headless builds that do not require narrow-phase collision detection.
